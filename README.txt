DESCRIPTION
- This project is designed for travel recommendation for Las Vegas. Combining with local attractions, we use data from Yelp and Airbnb to create a visualized recommendation web application. Given key words and user preference, we use NLP technique and similarity-based recommendation to retrieve top restaurants and hosts.

INSTALLATION
- This package runs based on Node.js with map infrastructure from Leaflets.js and Truf.js. Current version is a local version and contains all required files to run locally. Please first download Node.js (12.13).

EXECUTION
- Enter the main directory of project and enter "node index.js". A local server will be run on 8080 port. Enter "http://localhost:8080/" in explorer (tested only on Chrome) and you will see the welcoming text.
